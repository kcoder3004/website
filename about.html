<h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>I'm a middle schooler who loves to code, play basketball, and eat. I started coding in 2021 (consistently 2023) and have been learning ever since. I enjoy creating projects that challenge me and help me grow as a programmer.</p>
    
  <p>My favorite programming languages are Python and JavaScript, but I'm always open to learning new ones.</p>
  <p>Feel free to reach out if you want to collaborate on a project or just chat about coding!</p>
  <p>As of right now my favorist artist is Lil Uzi Vert, hence the background music</p>

<h2>What do I like to do?</h2>
<p class="githubp">In my freetime I like to <a class="githubhack" href="https://github.com/kcoder3004">hack</a>, play basketball, EAT, and read (rarely).</p>
